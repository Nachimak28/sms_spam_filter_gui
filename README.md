# SMS spam filter GUI app built to test DearPyGUI framework


This app is a simple spam filter app built using NLTK for the NLP functions and DearPyGUI for the GUI (obviously!).
It is a replication of the app build in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RocXKPPx4o) video .

Unfortunately, the [original codebase](https://github.com/MariyaSha/SimpleSMSspamFilter_GUI) was built using an older version of the dearpygui app, hence I've replicated the app with the newest API of DearPyGUI.

## Steps to run the app

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Nachimak28/sms_spam_filter_gui
```

Change directory into the sms_spam_filter_gui
```
cd sms_spam_filter_gui
```

Install the dependencies - preferrably in conda or vitrual env
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change directory into src folder
```
cd src
```

Run the code
```
python app.py
```

Feel free to create issues if you face any problems running the app.
